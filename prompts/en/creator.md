# [Content Creation Guidelines]

### 1. Brand Mentions & Tone Guidelines
- **User-centric writing:** This content should provide value to users, not serve as an advertisement.
- **Minimize brand mentions:** Only mention the brand name ('EasyTool.run') **once in the introduction and once in the conclusion**, naturally.
- **Use general pronouns:** In the main body, use expressions like 'this tool', 'here', 'this feature' to avoid repeating the brand name and prevent reader discomfort.

### 2. Markdown Styling Guide (Very Important)
1.  **Logical structure:** Use `##` and `###` to clearly express the hierarchical structure of the article.
2.  **Text emphasis:** Highlight key features, benefits, and important concepts (e.g., `client-side processing`, `no installation required`) with `**bold text**` to capture the reader's attention.
3.  **Code formatting:** Always wrap file names, commands, and code expressions like `crontab`, `* * * * *` in `` `inline code` `` format to enhance professionalism.
4.  **Use blockquotes:** Use `> blockquote` to visually separate problem statements that resonate with users or sentences you want to emphasize.
5.  **Use tables:** When comparing multiple items or explaining structured information (e.g., explaining each field in a cron expression), actively use markdown tables to visually organize information.
6.  **Link conversion rules (Newly added):** When mentioning URLs in the content, **always convert them to markdown links in the format `[link text](URL)`** rather than showing the URL as plain text. Make the link text natural, using feature names or relevant descriptions. (e.g., `Experience it now at [EasyTool.run's Cron Expression Converter](https://easytool.run/cron/convert)!`)

### 3. Required Sections (Follow the styling guide above)
1.  **Introduction:** Start with a `> blockquote` describing a problem situation where the '{name}' feature is needed to gain empathy, then offer a solution.
2.  **What is '{name}'? (Concept explanation):** Explain the basic concept and necessity tailored to the target audience's level. For cron expressions, include a **markdown table** explaining each field.
3.  **Key Benefits of This Tool:** Explain at least three special features in detail.
4.  **Detailed Usage Guide:** Following the 'text-only content principle', provide very detailed and specific text instructions step by step instead of using images. **Include markdown links using the 'Direct Link'.**
5.  **Advanced Tips for Experts:** Suggest 2-3 creative or professional usage scenarios for using the feature more effectively.
6.  **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):** Create at least three questions and answers that users might be most curious about regarding this topic.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key content of the article and encourage service use with a **markdown link using the 'Direct Link'**.

### 4. SEO Guidelines
- **Title:** Create a title that combines core features and benefits that users might search for, **excluding the brand name**.
- **Meta Description:** Write a summary of about 150 characters for search result exposure.
- **Meta Description** is important data, so it should adequately summarize the content.
